    <h1> My Testimony
        (The Knowledge I Gained from this Opportunity )
    </h1>
        <p>This training on Empowering Community ALS Implementers gave me a lot of great experiences and valuable learnings that makes me a competitive teacher in terms of digital citizenship. This training is a big help especially that we are in the 21st century where technology use is a must. It is also an amazing experience to be assisted by the instructors that show their experties on the field of computers and taught us the most basic computer parts and activity up to the complex ones such as making our own website.
         Knowing the basic parts  of computer and how to troubleshoot them made me more interested and curious. Creating charts and graphs enhance my ability to imagine and analyze more things. Last part of the training which is very interesting and will test your patience is when we make codes in HTML, making it is very challenging since it is a trial and error process especially it is my first time doing it. After that, another challenge is converting or making it as my website because there is a big possibilities there will be an error happen nut overall it is fun doing it. That summed up my learning experiences in my ICT training here at Northern Bukidnon State College. So grateful that I have this opportunity to be in this training since it is a big boost to my growth as a responsible and literate digital citizen. I am very greatful to be part of this training.
